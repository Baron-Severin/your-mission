Week 4 | Lesson 4

## Introduction

You have been recruited as a new employee at the Mi6:Q division straight out of your graduation from General Assembly. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a fake application to put on the phones of enemies of 007 so that we can track their communications.

Take a quick look at the dossier for your first mark. Your app should be designed to distract him with maximum efficiency while we analyze his data. M would also like a personal copy of your report sent to her email. Make sure she gets it!

## Dossier

### Sergei Ivanovich

#### Likes
  - Bad European Electronic Music
  - Cats
  - Videos
  - Russia

#### Dislikes
  - When a video ends
  - Pictures
  - Reading

## Exercise
#### Requirements

- Copy the messages and contacts of a user's phone when your application is run on it.
- Use a VideoView to distract Sergei while you are stealing his information.
- Don't include anything Sergei doesn't like in your application.
- Send an email to an address with the stolen information.
- Make ABSOLUTELY sure that Sergei doesn't get wind of what we are doing. Asking for permissions is fine, but don't show any popups when sending information to M. We are trying to keep our new technology secret.

**Bonus:**
- Steal more things besides Sergei's contacts and messages
- Make your application super annoying and distracting (while following the guidelines above)

#### Notes

- Don't worry about formatting. As long as M gets the information, she's happy.

- Remember to call a content resolver, use the code below

```java
  Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(Uri.parse("content://sms/"), null, null, null, null);
```
